        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Evaluation of the mediastinal main vascular structures is suboptimal due to the lack of contrast, but their calibrations are normal. Calcific atheroma plaques are observed in the aorta and coronary arteries. Heart size increased. No pericardial effusion or thickness increase was observed. No pleural effusion or increased thickness was detected. No mass appearance was observed in the precardiac fat pad. In the mediastinum, a few sequelae calcific lymph nodes, the largest of which is 9 mm in the pretracheal area, and hypodense hiluses can be distinguished, were primarily evaluated in favor of reactive lymph nodes. There was no lymphadenopathy in pathological size and appearance in both axillae and retropectoral regions. Esophageal wall thickness is normal. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Minimal bronchiectatic changes and peribronchial thickness increases are observed at the level of the hilum of both lungs. Linear densities, which may be compatible with pleuroparenchymal sequelae changes, are observed in the anterior segment of the right lung upper lobe. There is a sequela calcific pulmonary nodule in the posterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. Active infiltrative, consolidation was not detected in both lungs. Ventilation of both lungs is normal. There are pleural thickness increases in the lower lobe of the left lung, which are evaluated in favor of minimal sequelae in the posterior subpleural area. In both kidneys included in the examination, appearances evaluated in favor of multiple cysts are observed. In the vertebral column, osteophytes are observed in the anterior of the vertebral corpus, which are fused with each other. No fracture, lytic-sclerotic lesion was detected. Mild scoliosis with left opening is observed in the thoracic region.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Calcific atheromatous plaques in coronary arteries.  Slight increase in heart size.  Several reactive-looking lymph nodes in the mediastinal area.  Minimal bronchiectatic changes and mild peribronchial thickness increases.  Sequelae of fibrotic densities in both lungs.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Evaluation of the mediastinal main vascular structures is suboptimal due to the lack of contrast, but their calibrations are normal. Calcific atheroma plaques are observed in the aorta and coronary arteries. Heart size increased. No pericardial effusion or thickness increase was observed. No pleural effusion or increased thickness was detected. No mass appearance was observed in the precardiac fat pad. In the mediastinum, a few sequelae calcific lymph nodes, the largest of which is 9 mm in the pretracheal area, and hypodense hiluses can be distinguished, were primarily evaluated in favor of reactive lymph nodes. There was no lymphadenopathy in pathological size and appearance in both axillae and retropectoral regions. Esophageal wall thickness is normal. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Minimal bronchiectatic changes and peribronchial thickness increases are observed at the level of the hilum of both lungs. Linear densities, which may be compatible with pleuroparenchymal sequelae changes, are observed in the anterior segment of the right lung upper lobe. There is a sequela calcific pulmonary nodule in the posterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. Active infiltrative, consolidation was not detected in both lungs. Ventilation of both lungs is normal. There are pleural thickness increases in the lower lobe of the left lung, which are evaluated in favor of minimal sequelae in the posterior subpleural area. In both kidneys included in the examination, appearances evaluated in favor of multiple cysts are observed. In the vertebral column, osteophytes are observed in the anterior of the vertebral corpus, which are fused with each other. No fracture, lytic-sclerotic lesion was detected. Mild scoliosis with left opening is observed in the thoracic region.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Calcific atheromatous plaques in coronary arteries.  Slight increase in heart size.  Several reactive-looking lymph nodes in the mediastinal area.  Minimal bronchiectatic changes and mild peribronchial thickness increases.  Sequelae of fibrotic densities in both lungs.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

The largest of these lymph nodes is observed in the subcarinal region and its short diameter is 15 mm. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are noted.\n\nPleura: There is bilateral pleural effusion. The pleural effusion measured 50 mm on the right at its thickest point. The pleural effusion continues to the apex of both lungs when the patient is in the supine position. There is bilateral pleural effusion.\n\nEsophagus: There is no pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus within the sections. There is an occlusive hiatal hernia at the lower end of the esophagus.\n\nTrachea and Bronchi: There is no obstructive pathology in the trachea and both main bronchi.\n\nLungs: There are uniform interlobular septal thickenings in both lungs. It was also observed in millimetric centriacinar nodules. It is understood that these findings are new. When evaluated together with the pleural effusion and the patient's clinical information, it was thought that the described manifestations might be due to pulmonary edema. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and physical examination findings. Apart from these, there are small consolidations in the right lung upper lobe posterior segment and lower lobe superior segment. These appearances may be due to pulmonary edema. This appearance may be less likely in pneumonic infiltrates. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and laboratory findings. Both lungs have millimetric nodules, some of which are calcific. No mass was detected in both lungs. Interlobular septal thickenings and centriacinar nodules are present in both lungs. The patient is recommended to be evaluated for pulmonary edema. Minor consolidations are noted in the right lung, which may be compatible with pulmonary edema or pneumonic infiltration. Millimetric nodules are present in both lungs.\n\nAbdomen: No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections.\n\nBones: There are no fractures or lytic-destructive lesions in the bone structures within the sections.\n\nVasculature: Atherosclerotic changes are present in the aorta and coronary arteries.\n\nDiaphragm: A hiatal hernia is present.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\nChronic renal failure in follow-up.",
        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

The widths of the mediastinal main vascular structures are normal. Pericardial effusion was not detected. There are lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilar regions. The largest of these lymph nodes is observed in the subcarinal region and its short diameter is 15 mm. There is bilateral pleural effusion. The pleural effusion measured 50 mm on the right at its thickest point. The pleural effusion continues to the apex of both lungs when the patient is in the supine position. There is no pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus within the sections. There is an occlusive hiatal hernia at the lower end of the esophagus. There is no obstructive pathology in the trachea and both main bronchi. There are uniform interlobular septal thickenings in both lungs. It was also observed in millimetric centriacinar nodules. It is understood that these findings are new. When evaluated together with the pleural effusion and the patient's clinical information, it was thought that the described manifestations might be due to pulmonary edema. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and physical examination findings. Apart from these, there are small consolidations in the right lung upper lobe posterior segment and lower lobe superior segment. These appearances may be due to pulmonary edema. This appearance may be less likely in pneumonic infiltrates. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and laboratory findings. Both lungs have millimetric nodules, some of which are calcific. No mass was detected in both lungs. No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections. There are no fractures or lytic-destructive lesions in the bone structures within the sections.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Chronic renal failure in follow-up.  Bilateral pleural effusion, interlobular septal thickenings and centriacinar nodules in both lungs (patient is recommended to be evaluated for pulmonary edema).  Minor consolidations in the right lung, which may again be compatible with pulmonary edema or pneumonic infiltration.  Millimetric nodules in both lungs.  Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.  Atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and coronary arteries.  Hiatal hernia.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

The catheter terminates in the right atrium.\n\nHeart: Heart contour and size are normal.\n\nVascular Structures: There are atheromatous plaques in the aorta and coronary arteries.\n\nMediastinal Vascular Structures: The widths of the mediastinal main vascular structures are normal.\n\nPericardium: Pericardial effusion was not detected.\n\nLymph Nodes: There are lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilar regions. The largest of these lymph nodes is observed in the subcarinal region and its short diameter is 15 mm. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are noted.\n\nPleura: There is bilateral pleural effusion. The pleural effusion measured 50 mm on the right at its thickest point. The pleural effusion continues to the apex of both lungs when the patient is in the supine position. There is bilateral pleural effusion.\n\nEsophagus: There is no pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus within the sections. There is an occlusive hiatal hernia at the lower end of the esophagus.\n\nTrachea and Bronchi: There is no obstructive pathology in the trachea and both main bronchi.\n\nLungs: There are uniform interlobular septal thickenings in both lungs. It was also observed in millimetric centriacinar nodules. It is understood that these findings are new. When evaluated together with the pleural effusion and the patient's clinical information, it was thought that the described manifestations might be due to pulmonary edema. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and physical examination findings. Apart from these, there are small consolidations in the right lung upper lobe posterior segment and lower lobe superior segment. These appearances may be due to pulmonary edema. This appearance may be less likely in pneumonic infiltrates. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and laboratory findings. Both lungs have millimetric nodules, some of which are calcific. No mass was detected in both lungs. Interlobular septal thickenings and centriacinar nodules are present in both lungs. The patient is recommended to be evaluated for pulmonary edema. Minor consolidations are noted in the right lung, which may be compatible with pulmonary edema or pneumonic infiltration. Millimetric nodules are present in both lungs.\n\nAbdomen: No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections.\n\nBones: There are no fractures or lytic-destructive lesions in the bone structures within the sections.\n\nVasculature: Atherosclerotic changes are present in the aorta and coronary arteries.\n\nDiaphragm: A hiatal hernia is present.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\nChronic renal failure in follow-up.",
        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

The catheter terminates in the right atrium. Heart contour and size are normal. There are atheromatous plaques in the aorta and coronary arteries. The widths of the mediastinal main vascular structures are normal. Pericardial effusion was not detected. There are lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilar regions. The largest of these lymph nodes is observed in the subcarinal region and its short diameter is 15 mm. There is bilateral pleural effusion. The pleural effusion measured 50 mm on the right at its thickest point. The pleural effusion continues to the apex of both lungs when the patient is in the supine position. There is no pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus within the sections. There is an occlusive hiatal hernia at the lower end of the esophagus. There is no obstructive pathology in the trachea and both main bronchi. There are uniform interlobular septal thickenings in both lungs. It was also observed in millimetric centriacinar nodules. It is understood that these findings are new. When evaluated together with the pleural effusion and the patient's clinical information, it was thought that the described manifestations might be due to pulmonary edema. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and physical examination findings. Apart from these, there are small consolidations in the right lung upper lobe posterior segment and lower lobe superior segment. These appearances may be due to pulmonary edema. This appearance may be less likely in pneumonic infiltrates. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and laboratory findings. Both lungs have millimetric nodules, some of which are calcific. No mass was detected in both lungs. No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections. There are no fractures or lytic-destructive lesions in the bone structures within the sections.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Chronic renal failure in follow-up.  Bilateral pleural effusion, interlobular septal thickenings and centriacinar nodules in both lungs (patient is recommended to be evaluated for pulmonary edema).  Minor consolidations in the right lung, which may again be compatible with pulmonary edema or pneumonic infiltration.  Millimetric nodules in both lungs.  Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes.  Atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and coronary arteries.  Hiatal hernia.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

No pathological increase in wall thickness is observed in the thoracic esophagus. Sliding type mild hiatal hernia was observed at the lower end. In the mediastinum, in the supracalvicular fossa, in both axillary regions, no lymph nodes are observed in pathological size and appearance. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; No active infiltration or mass lesion was observed in both lungs. There is diffuse mild ectasia and minimal peribronchial thickness increase in bronchial structures. Sequela parenchymal changes are observed in bilateral apex, left upper lobe inferior lingular segment and right lung middle lobe medial segment. Millimetrically sized nonspecific nodules are observed in both lungs. No active infiltration or mass lesion was detected. Ventilation of both lungs is natural. In the upper abdominal sections within the image, no solid mass was detected as far as can be observed within the borders of non-contrast CT. No free fluid or loculated collection is observed. No lytic or destructive lesions were observed in the bone structures within the image, and the vertebral corpus heights were preserved.\n\nIMPRESSION: There is no finding in favor of pneumonic infiltration in both lung parenchyma, and sequela parenchymal changes are observed in bilateral apex, left upper lobe inferior lingular segment and middle lobe medial segment, and nonspecific nodules in millimetric sizes are observed in both lung parenchyma.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

No pericardial, pleural effusion or increased thickness was detected. Calibration of mediastinal vascular structures, heart contour, its size is natural. No pathological increase in wall thickness is observed in the thoracic esophagus. Sliding type mild hiatal hernia was observed at the lower end. In the mediastinum, in the supracalvicular fossa, in both axillary regions, no lymph nodes are observed in pathological size and appearance. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; No active infiltration or mass lesion was observed in both lungs. There is diffuse mild ectasia and minimal peribronchial thickness increase in bronchial structures. Sequela parenchymal changes are observed in bilateral apex, left upper lobe inferior lingular segment and right lung middle lobe medial segment. Millimetrically sized nonspecific nodules are observed in both lungs. No active infiltration or mass lesion was detected. Ventilation of both lungs is natural. In the upper abdominal sections within the image, no solid mass was detected as far as can be observed within the borders of non-contrast CT. No free fluid or loculated collection is observed. No lytic or destructive lesions were observed in the bone structures within the image, and the vertebral corpus heights were preserved.\n\nIMPRESSION: There is no finding in favor of pneumonic infiltration in both lung parenchyma, and sequela parenchymal changes are observed in bilateral apex, left upper lobe inferior lingular segment and middle lobe medial segment, and nonspecific nodules in millimetric sizes are observed in both lung parenchyma. There are calcified atheroma plaques in millimetric sizes in the wall of the thoracic aorta.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

In both lungs, there are confluent patches of ground glass areas in which air bronchograms are observed and interlobular septal thickness increases in the lower lobes are accompanied. Findings are consistent with viral pneumonia. Subsegmental atelectasis areas are observed in the posterior segments of both lung lower lobes and newly emerged. No pathological increase in wall thickness was observed in the esophagus. As far as it can be evaluated within the non-contrast CT limits; 13 mm in diameter hypodense lesion in the subcapsular area in liver segment 8 is stable (cyst?). No lytic-destructive lesions were observed in the bone structures within the sections.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Widespread ground-glass areas of confluence accompanied by interlobular septal thickness increases in the lower lobes of both lungs; findings are consistent with viral pneumonia.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

No enlarged lymph node was detected in the mediastinum and bilateral hilar regions in pathological size and appearance. Trachea and both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. No significant difference was found between the examinations in terms of the number and size of multiple calcific parenchymal metastases with a diameter of 2 cm in both lungs, the largest of which is in the posterior segment of the left lung lower lobe. In both lungs, there are confluent patches of ground glass areas in which air bronchograms are observed and interlobular septal thickness increases in the lower lobes are accompanied. Findings are consistent with viral pneumonia. Subsegmental atelectasis areas are observed in the posterior segments of both lung lower lobes and newly emerged. No pathological increase in wall thickness was observed in the esophagus. As far as it can be evaluated within the non-contrast CT limits; 13 mm in diameter hypodense lesion in the subcapsular area in liver segment 8 is stable (cyst?). No lytic-destructive lesions were observed in the bone structures within the sections.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Widespread ground-glass areas of confluence accompanied by interlobular septal thickness increases in the lower lobes of both lungs; findings are consistent with viral pneumonia. Its prevalence has decreased partially.  Areas of subsegmental atelectasis in the posterior segments of the lower lobes of both lungs.  Stable, calcific parenchymal metastases in both lungs.  Several hypodense nodules in the right thyroid lobe; is stable.  Dilatation of the ascending aorta.  Stable hypodense lesion (cyst?) in the right lobe of the liver.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Trachea and lumen of both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and lumen of both main bronchi. Mediastinal structures were evaluated as suboptimal since the examination was unenhanced. As far as can be observed: Calibration of thoracic main vascular structures is natural. No dilatation was detected in the thoracic aorta. Heart contour size is natural. Pericardial thickening-effusion was not detected. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. No lymph node was detected in mediastinal and bilateral hilar pathological size and appearance. When both lungs are evaluated in the parenchyma window: Pleuroparenchymal sequelae increase in density and paracicatricial bronchiectasis were observed in the upper lobe of the right lung. An increase in pleuroparenchymal sequelae density was observed in the laterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung. A few calcified lymph nodes measuring 3.5 mm in diameter and 3 mm in diameter in the left lung were observed in the middle lobe and upper lobe of the right lung. Bilateral pleural thickening-effusion was not detected. Liver size increased. Other upper abdominal sections within the examination area are normal. Bilateral adrenal gland calibration was normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. No lytic-destructive lesion was detected in bone structures.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Sequelae changes in the right lung.  Calcified nonspecific parenchymal nodules in both lungs.  Hepatomegaly.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Several lymph nodes with a short axis of 9 mm are observed in the pre-tracheal area. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Interseptal thickness increases and fibrotic densities are observed in the apical anterior part of the upper lobe of the right lung, and in the anterior part of the upper lobe of the left lung, which is considered primarily in favor of a sequelae change. Several pulmonary nodules were observed in both lungs, the largest of which was 5 mm in diameter, located laterally in the upper lobe of the right lung. Pleural effusion reaching a thickness of 4 cm on the left and 4.5 cm on the right and atelectasis in the accompanying parenchyma are observed in both lungs. Effusion is observed in the fissures. The upper abdominal organs included in the examination appear natural. No fractures, lytic or sclerotic lesions were detected in the bones.\n\nIMPRESSION: Pleural effusion and concomitant compression atelectasis in both lungs. Nonspecific nodules in both lungs.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Several lymph nodes with a short axis of 9 mm are observed in the pre-tracheal area. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Interseptal thickness increases and fibrotic densities are observed in the apical anterior part of the upper lobe of the right lung, and in the anterior part of the upper lobe of the left lung, which is considered primarily in favor of a sequelae change. Several pulmonary nodules were observed in both lungs, the largest of which was 5 mm in diameter, located laterally in the upper lobe of the right lung. Pleural effusion reaching a thickness of 4 cm on the left and 4.5 cm on the right and atelectasis in the accompanying parenchyma are observed in both lungs. Effusion is observed in the fissures. The upper abdominal organs included in the examination appear natural. No fractures, lytic or sclerotic lesions were detected in the bones.\n\nIMPRESSION: Pleural effusion and concomitant compression atelectasis in both lungs. Nonspecific nodules in both lungs.  Cardiomegaly and minimal pericardial effusion. Patient 14.10.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and sagittal reformations were reviewed.\n\nFINDINGS:\nNo acute abnormality is seen in the visualized lung bases. The liver is normal in size and contour.

Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Several calcific nodules, 3 mm in size, were observed in both lungs. No pneumonic infiltration was detected. Upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Millimetric calcific nodules in both lungs\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\".

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

No enlarged lymph nodes were detected in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Widespread patchy ground glass areas are observed in both lungs, which are more prominent in the right lung, usually subpleural, forming consolidation from place to place. The outlook is consistent with typical-probable Covid. No nodular or infiltrative lesion was detected in the lung parenchyma. Upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Calibration of other vascular structures of the mediastinum is natural. Heart contour, size is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Millimetric calcific atheroma plaques were observed in the aorta. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Minimal emphysematous changes were observed in both lungs. Pleuroparenchymal fibroatelectatic sequelae changes were observed in the right lung middle lobe and left lung upper lobe lingular segment and in both lung lower lobe basal segments. No mass lesion-active infiltration with distinguishable borders was detected in both lungs. As far as can be seen within the sections; upper abdominal organs are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Calcific atheroma plaque in the aorta.  Emphysematous changes in both lungs.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

As far as can be seen; Mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; pleuroparenchymal sequelae density increases were observed in both lung apical segments. Ground-glass opacities extending along the peribronchial area and focal thickening of the pleura were observed in the posterior segment of the right lung upper lobe. Appearance is nonspecific. In the first plan, it was evaluated in favor of sequelae. However, the outlook is risky for early viral pneumonia, albeit low. Clinic and lab. correlation is recommended. Apart from this, no mass lesion-active infiltration with distinguishable borders was detected in both lungs. When the upper abdominal organs included in the sections were evaluated; Accessory spleen with a diameter of 12 mm was observed in the inferior of the splenic hilus. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved.\n\nIMPRESSION: Ground-glass dasity extending along the peribronchial area in the posterior segment of the right lung upper lobe and focal thickening of the visceral pleura in the periphery were initially evaluated in favor of sequelae changes. However, the appearance is risky in terms of early viral pneumonia, albeit low. Clinical and laboratory correlation is recommended .

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

As far as can be seen; Mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; pleuroparenchymal sequelae density increases were observed in both lung apical segments. Ground-glass opacities extending along the peribronchial area and focal thickening of the pleura were observed in the posterior segment of the right lung upper lobe. Appearance is nonspecific. In the first plan, it was evaluated in favor of sequelae. However, the outlook is risky for early viral pneumonia, albeit low. Clinic and lab. correlation is recommended. Apart from this, no mass lesion-active infiltration with distinguishable borders was detected in both lungs. When the upper abdominal organs included in the sections were evaluated; Accessory spleen with a diameter of 12 mm was observed in the inferior of the splenic hilus. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved.\n\nIMPRESSION: Ground-glass dasity extending along the peribronchial area in the posterior segment of the right lung upper lobe and focal thickening of the visceral pleura in the periphery were initially evaluated in favor of sequelae changes. However, the appearance is risky in terms of early viral pneumonia, albeit low. Clinical and laboratory correlation is recommended .

As far as can be seen; mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal.\n\nPericardium: Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed.\n\nSupraclavicular Lymph Nodes: Pathological lymph nodes were observed in the bilateral supraclavicular region, measuring 25x14 mm in size on the left and 12x10 mm in size on the right.\n\nMediastinal Lymph Nodes: Lymph nodes of 15x13 mm in pathological size and appearance were observed adjacent to the left subclavian artery and at the level of the left aortapulmonary window, the largest of which was adjacent to the left subclavian artery. In other parts of the mediastinum, lymph nodes with short axes less than 1 cm that did not reach pathological dimensions were observed. It is also present in previous examinations. No significant difference was detected.\n\nPleural Effusion: In both hemithorax, effusion measuring 16.\n\nPleura: In the left hemithorax, thickening of the posterior costal pleura is observed. It is stable.\n\nEsophagus: Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected.\n\nLungs: Patchy ground-glass consolidations were observed in the right lung apex, anterior and posterior segments, and in the peripheral subpleural areas of the middle lobe, forming a crazy paving pattern. The findings described may be compatible with radiation pneumonia or Covid-19 pneumonia. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory. Suspicious ground glass opacities are also observed in the peripheral subpleural areas of the left lung lingular segment.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Pathological lymph nodes were observed in the bilateral supraclavicular region, measuring 25x14 mm in size on the left and 12x10 mm in size on the right. Lymph nodes of 15x13 mm in pathological size and appearance were observed adjacent to the left subclavian artery and at the level of the left aortapulmonary window, the largest of which was adjacent to the left subclavian artery. In other parts of the mediastinum, lymph nodes with short axes less than 1 cm that did not reach pathological dimensions were observed. It is also present in previous examinations. No significant difference was detected. In both hemithorax, effusion measuring 16. In the left hemithorax, thickening of the posterior costal pleura is observed. It is stable. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Patchy ground-glass consolidations were observed in the right lung apex, anterior and posterior segments, and in the peripheral subpleural areas of the middle lobe, forming a crazy paving pattern. The findings described may be compatible with radiation pneumonia or Covid-19 pneumonia. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory. Suspicious ground glass opacities are also observed in the peripheral subpleural areas of the left lung lingular segment. A few millimetric nonspecific parenchymal nodules were observed in both lungs. In the non-contrast examination, intra-abdominal solid organs and vascular structures could not be evaluated. Further testing is recommended. Destruction area compatible with metastasis was observed in the sternum corpus. PET-CT examination revealed that FDG uptake belonging to metastasis in the thoracic vertebral corpus was found in the patient, and no lytic-destructive lesion in favor of metastasis was detected in the vertebrae within the CT limits.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Postoperative sequelae changes in the operation site in the patient who was learned to have had right mystectomy and axillary curettage.  Pathological lymph nodes adjacent to bilateral supraclavicular, aortopulmonary, and left subclavian arteries; is stable.  Stable lymph nodes that do not reach pathological dimensions in other parts of the mediastinum.  Slightly increased pleural effusion in the right hemithorax, stable sequelae thickening in the left posterior costal pleura.  Patchy ground glass consolidations with crazy paving patterns in the peripheral subpleural areas of the upper and lower lobe of the right lung; the outlook may be compatible with radiation pneumonia or Covid-19 pneumonia. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory.  Millimetric pulmonary nodules in both lungs; is stable.  Metastatic mass lesions thought to increase in number and size in both lobes of the liver, although optimal evaluation could not be made in the examination performed without IV contrast; Further examination is recommended.  Metastasis in the sternum corpus\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Thickening of the skin in the operation site, and increases in density consistent with post-op sequelae changes in subcutaneous fat planes were observed. Surgical suture materials were observed in the operation site and right axilla. A mass lesion with distinguishable borders in the left breast, no lymph node in pathological size and appearance was observed in the left axilla. Trachea and both main bronchi were in the midline and no obstructive pathology was detected in the lumen. On the left, a catheter image extending to the port chamber and superior-right atrium junction of the vena cava and anterior chest wall was observed. In the non-contrast examination, the mediastinum was not evaluated optimally. As far as can be seen; mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Pathological lymph nodes were observed in the bilateral supraclavicular region, measuring 25x14 mm in size on the left and 12x10 mm in size on the right. Lymph nodes of 15x13 mm in pathological size and appearance were observed adjacent to the left subclavian artery and at the level of the left aortapulmonary window, the largest of which was adjacent to the left subclavian artery. In other parts of the mediastinum, lymph nodes with short axes less than 1 cm that did not reach pathological dimensions were observed. It is also present in previous examinations. No significant difference was detected. In both hemithorax, effusion measuring 16. In the left hemithorax, thickening of the posterior costal pleura is observed. It is stable. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Patchy ground-glass consolidations were observed in the right lung apex, anterior and posterior segments, and in the peripheral subpleural areas of the middle lobe, forming a crazy paving pattern. The findings described may be compatible with radiation pneumonia or Covid-19 pneumonia. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory. Suspicious ground glass opacities are also observed in the peripheral subpleural areas of the left lung lingular segment. A few millimetric nonspecific parenchymal nodules were observed in both lungs. In the non-contrast examination, intra-abdominal solid organs and vascular structures could not be evaluated. Further testing is recommended. Destruction area compatible with metastasis was observed in the sternum corpus. PET-CT examination revealed that FDG uptake belonging to metastasis in the thoracic vertebral corpus was found in the patient, and no lytic-destructive lesion in favor of metastasis was detected in the vertebrae within the CT limits.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Postoperative sequelae changes in the operation site in the patient who was learned to have had right mystectomy and axillary curettage.  Pathological lymph nodes adjacent to bilateral supraclavicular, aortopulmonary, and left subclavian arteries; is stable.  Stable lymph nodes that do not reach pathological dimensions in other parts of the mediastinum.  Slightly increased pleural effusion in the right hemithorax, stable sequelae thickening in the left posterior costal pleura.  Patchy ground glass consolidations with crazy paving patterns in the peripheral subpleural areas of the upper and lower lobe of the right lung; the outlook may be compatible with radiation pneumonia or Covid-19 pneumonia. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory.  Millimetric pulmonary nodules in both lungs; is stable.  Metastatic mass lesions thought to increase in number and size in both lobes of the liver, although optimal evaluation could not be made in the examination performed without IV contrast; Further examination is recommended.  Metastasis in the sternum corpus\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

It caused compression in the bronchial lumens. It may belong to new metastatic lesions. Contrast-enhanced examination will be appropriate.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

In the case with bone metastases, no space-occupying lesion that can be distinguished by CT was observed in the bone structures.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Metastatic breast Ca  Findings compatible with Covid pneumonia  Bilateral supraclavicular right axillary and mediastinal lymph node metastases, hilar-located mass lesions that cause stenosis due to pushing in the lumens of both main bronchi, cannot be evaluated clearly due to lack of contrast agent. However, it is not present in his previous study. It was evaluated with high suspicion in favor of new metastasis. Contrast-enhanced examination is recommended.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Heart dimensions and compartments are of normal width. Pericardial effusion was not detected. Calibrations of mediastinal major vascular structures are natural. The air passages of the trachea, both main bronchi, lobar and segmental bronchi are open. Wall thickness increases are observed in segmental bronchi. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; There is no pneumonic infiltration or consolidation area in the lung parenchyma. Slight parenchymal distortion and linear atelectasis area are observed in the right lung upper lobe anterior segment, lower lobe anterobasal and left lung lower lobe posterobasal segment. No loculated or free fluid was observed in the upper abdominal sections. Thinning of the parenchyma thickness of both kidneys and dilatation in the collecting system are observed. Both kidneys are partially sectioned. No lytic-destructive lesions were detected in bone structures.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Areas of mild parenchymal distortion and linear atelectasis in both lungs.  Thinning of both kidney parenchyma thickness and dilatation in both kidney collecting systems.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

The described findings are the findings frequently observed in Covid-19 pneumonia. During the pandemic process, these findings were evaluated in favor of Covid-19 pneumonia. No mass was detected in both lungs. Mediastinal structures cannot be evaluated optimally because contrast material is not given. As far as can be observed: Heart contour and size are normal. No pleural or pericardial effusion was detected. The widths of the mediastinal main vascular structures are normal. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the mediastinum and hilar regions. No pathological wall thickness increase was observed in the esophagus within the sections. No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections. In the upper abdominal organs within the sections, no mass with distinguishable borders was detected as far as it can be observed within the borders of non-enhanced CT. Thoracic vertebral corpus heights, alignments and densities are normal. Intervertebral disc distances are preserved. The neural foramina are open. No lytic-destructive lesions were detected in the bone structures within the sections.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Findings evaluated in favor of viral pneumonia in both lungs.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

As far as can be observed, there are calcified atheroma plaques on the walls of the thoracic aorta and coronary vascular structures. An increase in heart size is observed. There is pericardial effusion. No pleural effusion or increased thickness was detected. Trachea, both main bronchi are open and no obstructive pathology is observed. No pathological increase in wall thickness was detected in the thoracic esophagus. In the mediastinum, no lymph nodes were detected in pathological size and appearance in both axillary regions. In the examination made in the lung parenchyma window; No active infiltration or mass lesion was detected in both lungs. There are minimal ectasia and diffuse peribronchial thickness increases in the bronchial structures of both lungs, which are evident in the center. A millimetric nonspecific nodule was observed in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung. No free fluid or loculated collection was detected in the upper abdominal sections within the image. In the corpus of the left adrenal gland, a lesion measuring approximately 40x30 mm and evaluated in favor of a low-density adenoma was observed. No lytic or destructive lesions were observed in the bone structures within the image. There are osteophytic degenerative changes in the vertebral corpus corners that tend to merge in the right anterolateral.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Increased heart size, thoracic aorta, calcified atheroma plaques in the wall of coronary vascular structures, and pericardial effusion.  Diffuse mild ectasia and diffuse peribronchial diffuse minimal thickness increase in the central bronchial structures of both lungs, a millimetric nodule in the anterior segment of the right lung upper lobe.  A lesion evaluated in favor of adenoma in the corpus of the left adrenal gland.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

In the 4th rib on the right, slight irregularities in the cortex and heterogeneity in the medullary bone structure are observed. Peripheral sclerotic millimetric nonspecific lesion is observed in the left 4th rib. On the left, at the level of the pectoral muscles, a density compatible with another foreign body with a diameter of 5 mm is observed.\n\nIMPRESSION: Densities compatible with foreign body in the left lung and at the level of the left pectoral muscles. Findings consistent with emphysema.  Millimetric lesion consistent with adenoma with negative HU density values of approximately 8 mm in the left adrenal genus. Slight irregularities in the cortex at the 4th rib on the right, heterogeneity in the medullary bone structure. Peripheral sclerotic millimetric nonspecific lesion in the left 4th rib.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

There is a nonspecific nodule with a diameter of 3 mm at the mediobasal level of the lower lobe of the right lung. Density increases consistent with pleuroparenchymal sequelae are observed in the inferior lingular segment. At the lower lobe posterobasal level, approximately 6x4 mm in size in the periphery, and in the subpleural area in the lateral lower lobe superior segment, densities compatible with a foreign body with a diameter of 3 mm were observed. In the upper abdominal organs included in the sections, unenhanced segments of the liver and spleen that fall into the examination area are normal. Right adrenal is normal. In the left adrenal genus, there is a millimetric lesion compatible with adenoma with a diameter of approximately 8 mm and negative HU density values. In the 4th rib on the right, slight irregularities in the cortex and heterogeneity in the medullary bone structure are observed. Peripheral sclerotic millimetric nonspecific lesion is observed in the left 4th rib. On the left, at the level of the pectoral muscles, a density compatible with another foreign body with a diameter of 5 mm is observed.\n\nIMPRESSION: Densities compatible with foreign body in the left lung and at the level of the left pectoral muscles.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and sagittal reformations were reviewed.\n\nFINDINGS:\nNo acute abnormality is seen in the visualized lung bases. The liver is normal in size and contour.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

In lung parenchyma evaluation; There are areas of pneumonic infiltration in both lungs that become prominent towards the bilaterally widespread basals and increase in density and density towards the bases. Ground glass density in the upper lobes is observed as consolidation areas in the lower lobes. Radiological findings were evaluated as compatible with Covid pneumonia. No pleural effusion was detected. No features were detected in the upper abdomen sections. No lytic-destructive lesions were detected in bone structures.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with Covid pneumonia.  Increase in heart size.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

In the pandemic process, it is recommended to evaluate the case in the first place in terms of Covid pneumonia together with clinical and laboratory findings. However, the accompanying right lower lobe lobar pneumonia could not be excluded. Pleuroparenchymal sequelae changes are observed in the right middle lobe. There is a 3 mm diameter nodule superposed on the interlobar fissure in the posterior segment of the upper lobe on the right. Bilateral pleural effusion pneumothorax was not detected. Upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal. A decrease in density consistent with steatosis is observed in the liver entering the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Nodular densities, which may be compatible with accessory spleen, are observed in the spleen hilum. Surrounding soft tissue plans are natural. Minimal degenerative changes are observed in the bone structure.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Large consolidative parenchyma area including air bronchograms starting from the lower lobe superior segment in both lungs and continuing towards the baseline in the right lung, scattered focal ground-glass-style density increases-consolidation areas in both lungs, clinical and laboratory findings of the case in terms of Covid pneumonia in the first place during the pandemic process.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

No lymph node with pathological size and configuration was detected at the mediastinal and hilar level. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Both hemithorax are symmetrical. Calibration of the trachea and main bronchi is normal. Lumens are clear. In both lungs, a large consolidative parenchyma area is observed including air bronchograms starting from the lower lobe superior segment and continuing towards the base in the right lung. Apart from this, there are scattered focal ground-glass-style density beats-consolidation areas in both lungs. In the pandemic process, it is recommended to evaluate the case in the first place in terms of Covid pneumonia together with clinical and laboratory findings. However, the accompanying right lower lobe lobar pneumonia could not be excluded. Pleuroparenchymal sequelae changes are observed in the right middle lobe. There is a 3 mm diameter nodule superposed on the interlobar fissure in the posterior segment of the upper lobe on the right. Bilateral pleural effusion pneumothorax was not detected. Upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal. A decrease in density consistent with steatosis is observed in the liver entering the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Nodular densities, which may be compatible with accessory spleen, are observed in the spleen hilum. Surrounding soft tissue plans are natural. Minimal degenerative changes are observed in the bone structure.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Large consolidative parenchyma area including air bronchograms starting from the lower lobe superior segment in both lungs and continuing towards the baseline in the right lung, scattered focal ground-glass-style density increases-consolidation areas in both lungs, clinical and laboratory findings of the case in terms of Covid pneumonia in the first place during the pandemic process. It is recommended to be evaluated together. However, the accompanying right lower lobe lobar pneumonia could not be excluded.  Hepatosteatosis.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Calibration of thoracic main vascular structures is natural. No dilatation was detected in the thoracic aorta. Heart contour size is natural. Pericardial thickening-effusion was not detected. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. No lymph node was detected in mediastinal and bilateral hilar pathological size and appearance. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Subsegmental atelectatic changes were observed in the left lung inferior lingular segment. Mild emphysematous changes are present in both lungs. Subsegmental atelectatic changes were observed in the left lung lower lobe mediobasal segment. Subsegmental atelectasis was observed in the medial segment of the right lung middle lobe. Upper abdominal sections entering the examination area are natural. Bilateral adrenal gland calibration was normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. No lytic-destructive lesion was detected in bone structures.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Mild emphysematous changes in both lungs, subsegmental atelectasis in both lungs.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

In the lower lobes of both lungs, there are areas of increased density consistent with linear atelectasis in the left lung inferior lingular segment. As far as it can be observed within the limits of non-contrast CT in the upper abdominal sections within the image; no solid mass was detected. No free fluid or loculated collection is observed. Stable lytic lesions are observed in the bone structures within the image. Vertebra corpus heights and alignments are natural. There are osteophytic degenerative changes that tend to coalesce at the vertebral corpus corners.\n\nIMPRESSION: Findings consistent with viral pneumonia in both lungs, areas of increased density consistent with linear atelectasis in both lung lower lobe posterobasal segment and left lung upper lobe lingula inferior lingular segment. Stable lytic bone lesions in bone structures within the image.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.
