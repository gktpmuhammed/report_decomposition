        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

In the mediastinum, a few sequelae calcific lymph nodes, the largest of which is 9 mm in the pretracheal area, and hypodense hiluses can be distinguished, were primarily evaluated in favor of reactive lymph nodes. There was no lymphadenopathy in pathological size and appearance in both axillae and retropectoral regions. Esophageal wall thickness is normal. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Minimal bronchiectatic changes and peribronchial thickness increases are observed at the level of the hilum of both lungs. Linear densities, which may be compatible with pleuroparenchymal sequelae changes, are observed in the anterior segment of the right lung upper lobe. There is a sequela calcific pulmonary nodule in the posterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. Active infiltrative, consolidation was not detected in both lungs. Ventilation of both lungs is normal. There are pleural thickness increases in the lower lobe of the left lung, which are evaluated in favor of minimal sequelae in the posterior subpleural area. In both kidneys included in the examination, appearances evaluated in favor of multiple cysts are observed. In the vertebral column, osteophytes are observed in the anterior of the vertebral corpus, which are fused with each other. No fracture, lytic-sclerotic lesion was detected.

When evaluated together with the pleural effusion and the patient's clinical information, it was thought that the described manifestations might be due to pulmonary edema. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and physical examination findings. These appearances may be due to pulmonary edema. This appearance may be less likely in pneumonic infiltrates. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and laboratory findings.\n\nHeart: Heart contour and size are normal.\n\nAorta and Coronary Arteries: There are atheromatous plaques in the aorta and coronary arteries.\n\nMediastinum: The widths of the mediastinal main vascular structures are normal.\n\nPericardium: Pericardial effusion was not detected.\n\nLymph Nodes: There are lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilar regions. The largest of these lymph nodes is observed in the subcarinal region and its short diameter is 15 mm.\n\nPleura: There is bilateral pleural effusion. The pleural effusion measured 50 mm on the right at its thickest point. The pleural effusion continues to the apex of both lungs when the patient is in the supine position.\n\nEsophagus: There is no pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus within the sections.

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

The catheter terminates in the right atrium. Heart contour and size are normal. There are atheromatous plaques in the aorta and coronary arteries. The widths of the mediastinal main vascular structures are normal. Pericardial effusion was not detected. There are lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilar regions. The largest of these lymph nodes is observed in the subcarinal region and its short diameter is 15 mm. There is bilateral pleural effusion. The pleural effusion measured 50 mm on the right at its thickest point. The pleural effusion continues to the apex of both lungs when the patient is in the supine position. There is no pathological wall thickness increase in the esophagus within the sections. There is an occlusive hiatal hernia at the lower end of the esophagus. There is no obstructive pathology in the trachea and both main bronchi. There are uniform interlobular septal thickenings in both lungs. It was also observed in millimetric centriacinar nodules. It is understood that these findings are new. When evaluated together with the pleural effusion and the patient's clinical information, it was thought that the described manifestations might be due to pulmonary edema. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and physical examination findings. Apart from these, there are small consolidations in the right lung upper lobe posterior segment and lower lobe superior segment. These appearances may be due to pulmonary edema. This appearance may be less likely in pneumonic infiltrates. It is recommended to evaluate the patient together with clinical and laboratory findings. Both lungs have millimetric nodules, some of which are calcific. No mass was detected in both lungs. No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections. There are no fractures or lytic-destructive lesions in the bone structures within the sections.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Pleuroparenchymal sequela fibrotic density increases were observed in the apical and posterior segment of the right lung upper lobe, and in the left lung upper lobe apicoposterior segment, which also causes pleural thickening. In both lungs, nonspecific parenchymal nodules with a diameter of 7.1 mm were observed in the anterobasal subsegment of the lower lobe anterobasal segment, the largest of which was 7.1 mm on the right, and 3 mm in diameter, on the left. No mass lesion-active infiltration with distinguishable borders was detected in the lung parenchyma. As far as can be seen within the sections; upper abdominal organs are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Osteopenia was observed in the thoracolumbar vertebrae within the sections. Vertebral corpus heights are natural.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

No pericardial, pleural effusion or increased thickness was detected. Calibration of mediastinal vascular structures, heart contour, its size is natural. No pathological increase in wall thickness is observed in the thoracic esophagus. Sliding type mild hiatal hernia was observed at the lower end. In the mediastinum, in the supracalvicular fossa, in both axillary regions, no lymph nodes are observed in pathological size and appearance. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; No active infiltration or mass lesion was observed in both lungs. There is diffuse mild ectasia and minimal peribronchial thickness increase in bronchial structures. Sequela parenchymal changes are observed in bilateral apex, left upper lobe inferior lingular segment and right lung middle lobe medial segment. Millimetrically sized nonspecific nodules are observed in both lungs. No active infiltration or mass lesion was detected. Ventilation of both lungs is natural. In the upper abdominal sections within the image, no solid mass was detected as far as can be observed within the borders of non-contrast CT. No free fluid or loculated collection is observed. No lytic or destructive lesions were observed in the bone structures within the image, and the vertebral corpus heights were preserved.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Although it does not rule out CMV pneumonia, the expected nodular infiltration or consolidation areas in CMV pneumonia were not observed. Mediastinal lymph node is not accompanied. Pleural effusion is not threshold. No new lesion was observed.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

No enlarged lymph node was detected in the mediastinum and bilateral hilar regions in pathological size and appearance. Trachea and both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and both main bronchi. No significant difference was found between the examinations in terms of the number and size of multiple calcific parenchymal metastases with a diameter of 2 cm in both lungs, the largest of which is in the posterior segment of the left lung lower lobe. In both lungs, there are confluent patches of ground glass areas in which air bronchograms are observed and interlobular septal thickness increases in the lower lobes are accompanied. Findings are consistent with viral pneumonia. Subsegmental atelectasis areas are observed in the posterior segments of both lung lower lobes and newly emerged. No pathological increase in wall thickness was observed in the esophagus. As far as it can be evaluated within the non-contrast CT limits; 13 mm in diameter hypodense lesion in the subcapsular area in liver segment 8 is stable (cyst?). No lytic-destructive lesions were observed in the bone structures within the sections.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Trachea and lumen of both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and lumen of both main bronchi. Mediastinal structures were evaluated as suboptimal since the examination was unenhanced. As far as can be observed: Calibration of thoracic main vascular structures is natural. No dilatation was detected in the thoracic aorta. Heart contour size is natural. Pericardial thickening-effusion was not detected. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. No lymph node was detected in mediastinal and bilateral hilar pathological size and appearance. When both lungs are evaluated in the parenchyma window: Pleuroparenchymal sequelae increase in density and paracicatricial bronchiectasis were observed in the upper lobe of the right lung. An increase in pleuroparenchymal sequelae density was observed in the laterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung. A few calcified lymph nodes measuring 3.5 mm in diameter and 3 mm in diameter in the left lung were observed in the middle lobe and upper lobe of the right lung. Bilateral pleural thickening-effusion was not detected. Liver size increased. Other upper abdominal sections within the examination area are normal. Bilateral adrenal gland calibration was normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. No lytic-destructive lesion was detected in bone structures.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

Interseptal thickness increases and fibrotic densities are observed in the apical anterior part of the upper lobe of the right lung, and in the anterior part of the upper lobe of the left lung, which is considered primarily in favor of a sequelae change. Several pulmonary nodules were observed in both lungs, the largest of which was 5 mm in diameter, located laterally in the upper lobe of the right lung. Pleural effusion reaching a thickness of 4 cm on the left and 4.5 cm on the right and atelectasis in the accompanying parenchyma are observed in both lungs. Effusion is observed in the fissures. The upper abdominal organs included in the examination appear natural. No fractures, lytic or sclerotic lesions were detected in the bones.",
        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

The mediastinum could not be evaluated optimally in the non-contrast examination. As far as can be observed: A port catheter extending to the right atrium is observed. Calcific plaques were observed in the aortic walls. Heart sizes increased and minimal pericardial effusion was observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Several lymph nodes with a short axis of 9 mm are observed in the pre-tracheal area. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Interseptal thickness increases and fibrotic densities are observed in the apical anterior part of the upper lobe of the right lung, and in the anterior part of the upper lobe of the left lung, which is considered primarily in favor of a sequelae change. Several pulmonary nodules were observed in both lungs, the largest of which was 5 mm in diameter, located laterally in the upper lobe of the right lung. Pleural effusion reaching a thickness of 4 cm on the left and 4.5 cm on the right and atelectasis in the accompanying parenchyma are observed in both lungs. Effusion is observed in the fissures. The upper abdominal organs included in the examination appear natural. No fractures, lytic or sclerotic lesions were detected in the bones.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"

Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. Mild hiatal hernia is observed. No lymph node with pathological size and configuration was detected in the mediastinum and hilar level. Coarse-millimetric calcifications are observed at the level of the areola in the right breast. There is also coarse calcification in the lower level of the areola in the left breast. Both hemithorax are symmetrical. Calibration of trachea and main bronchus is natural. Lumens are clear. 6x4 mm calcification is observed in the pleura in the right lung upper lobe anterior segment lateral. Also available in old review. There is advanced regression in the focal consolidation area, which was also observed in the previous examination, around the defined changes. At this level, there is a 2 mm diameter nodule. It could not be identified within the consolidation area in the previous review. There is prominence in the lower lobes of both lungs, especially in the subpleural interlobular septa at the laterobasal level. A stable 6x4 mm nodule is observed in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. There is another nodule with a diameter of 3 mm slightly inferiorly. Two nodules with a diameter of 3 mm are observed at the posterobasal level. There was no finding compatible with pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pneumonia. Degenerative changes are observed in the bone structure entering the examination area.",
        "raw_prompt": "# RadExtract Prompt\n\n## Task Description\n\nYou are a medical assistant specialized in categorizing radiology text into sections:\n\n- **findings_prefix** -- All text that appears before the actual \"findings\" content.\n- **findings_body** -- The main 'Findings' section. Each finding is classified into a possible section through a list of attributes, some of which may also be assigned to a subheader.\n- **findings_suffix** -- Any text that appears after the \"findings\" portion (such as \"Impression\" or other concluding content).\n\n### Section Categories:\n- **findings_prefix**: Use only for header information before clinical findings (examination details, clinical indication, technique). Never use for actual clinical observations or pathological findings.\n- **findings_body**: Use for all clinical findings, observations, and pathological descriptions.\n- **findings_suffix**: Use only for conclusions, impressions, or recommendations that appear after the main findings.\n\n### Critical Rule:\nIf a report contains only clinical findings without any header information, do not create a findings_prefix extraction. Start directly with findings_body extractions for the clinical content.\n\n**Example of findings-only content (NO prefix needed):**\nInput: \"There is a small joint effusion. The cartilage shows thinning.\"\nCorrect: Create only findings_body extractions for each clinical finding.\nIncorrect: Do not categorize clinical findings as findings_prefix.\n\n### Professional Output Standards:\nAll extracted text must maintain the grammatical correctness and professional coherence expected in radiology reports. Ensure that:\n- All sentences are complete and grammatically correct\n- Medical terminology is used appropriately and consistently\n- The language remains professional and clinical in tone\n- Correct obvious typos (e.g., \"splen\" \u2192 \"spleen\", \"kidny\" \u2192 \"kidney\")\n- Any modifications to the original text preserve the intended medical meaning\n- Minor typos are corrected and optimal punctuation is used\n\n### Empty prefix or suffix sections:\nOnly create extractions for sections that actually exist in the text. Do not create empty prefix or suffix sections if there is no corresponding content in the source text. If the text is findings-only without any impression/conclusion, do not create a findings_suffix extraction.\n\n### Section Usage Guidelines:\n\n**findings_prefix**: Reserved exclusively for header information that appears before clinical findings, such as:\n- Examination details (type of study, technique)\n- Clinical indication or history\n- Comparison studies referenced\n- Technical parameters\n\n**findings_body**: Contains the actual clinical findings and observations from the imaging study.\n\n**findings_suffix**: Reserved for concluding content that follows the findings, such as impressions or recommendations.\n\n**Critical Rule**: Clinical findings should never be categorized as prefix content. If a report begins directly with clinical observations without any header information, create only findings_body and findings_suffix extractions as appropriate.\n\n### Special guidance for findings_prefix organization:\nWhen the report has detailed prefix information with clear section headers (like EXAMINATION, CLINICAL INDICATION, COMPARISON, TECHNIQUE), create separate extractions for each section rather than one large block. Use the \"section\" attribute to label each part:\n- \"Examination\" for exam type/title\n- \"Clinical Indication\" for clinical history/reason for study  \n- \"Comparison\" for prior studies referenced\n- \"Technique\" for imaging parameters and acquisition details\n\n**Important:** Even when examination information appears at the beginning without an explicit \"EXAMINATION:\" header, it should still be labeled with section:\"Examination\". This includes standalone exam descriptions that identify the type of imaging study being performed.\n\nAlways recognize examination-type content and use section:\"Examination\" regardless of whether it has an explicit header.\n\nThis structured approach provides better organization and readability.\n\n### Critical for findings_suffix:\nDo NOT include headers like \"IMPRESSION:\", \"CONCLUSION:\", etc. in the extraction_text. Only extract the actual content that follows these headers. The formatting system will add appropriate headers automatically. \n\n**Example:** If the text contains \"IMPRESSION: 1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\", extract only \"1. Severe arthritis. 2. Labral tear.\" as the extraction_text.\n\n### Additional Notes for findings_body:\n- If a single sentence references multiple structures with a shared status (e.g., \"liver, gallbladder, spleen appear unremarkable\"), please split them into separate extraction lines, each referencing the relevant structure.\n- If the text mentions subheaders like \"CT ABDOMEN\" or \"CERVICAL SPINE,\" only create/retain that subheader if it clearly organizes multiple organ-structure findings under it. Do not force subheaders if only 1 or 2 lines belong there. A subheader should ideally group 3+ sections to be meaningful.\n\n### Special guidance for spine reports:\n- For spine imaging (MRI, CT), organize findings by anatomical level using the format: \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L1-L2\", \"Lumbar Spine Levels: L2-L3\", \"Cervical Spine Levels: C5-C6\", etc.\n- Separate general spine findings (alignment, lordosis, vertebral heights) from level-specific findings\n- Use dedicated sections for: \"Spinal Cord\", \"Bones\" (for marrow/vertebral body lesions), \"Paraspinal Soft Tissues\" (for muscle findings)\n- Each spinal level should get its own section when findings are described level-by-level\n- This level-by-level organization is preferred over generic \"Spine\" labeling for clinical utility\n\n### Non-spine skeletal findings:\nFor non-spine skeletal findings, unify them under a single section like \"Bones.\" Only keep laterality (Right/Left) if there is symmetry in the findings.\n\n## Required JSON Format\n\nEach final answer must be valid JSON with an array key \"extractions\". Each \"extraction\" is an object with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"text\": \"...\",\n  \"category\": \"findings_prefix\" | \"findings_body\" | \"findings_suffix\",\n  \"attributes\": {}\n}\n```\n\nWithin \"attributes\" each attribute should be a key-value pair as shown in the examples below. The attribute **\"clinical_significance\"** MUST be included for findings_body extractions and should be one of: **\"normal\"**, **\"minor\"**, **\"significant\"**, or **\"not_applicable\"** to indicate the importance of the finding.\n\n---\n\n# Few-Shot Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to properly structure different types of radiology reports:\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Text:**\n```\nEXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST\nCLINICAL INDICATION: Abdominal pain.\nCOMPARISON: None.\nTECHNIQUE: Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of intravenous contrast material.

Calibration of mediastinal major vascular structures is natural. Millimetric sized calcific atheroma plaques are observed in the aortic arch. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. Mild hiatal hernia is observed. No lymph node with pathological size and configuration was detected in the mediastinum and hilar level. Coarse-millimetric calcifications are observed at the level of the areola in the right breast. There is also coarse calcification in the lower level of the areola in the left breast. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Both hemithorax are symmetrical. Calibration of trachea and main bronchus is natural. Lumens are clear. 6x4 mm calcification is observed in the pleura in the right lung upper lobe anterior segment lateral. Also available in old review. There is advanced regression in the focal consolidation area, which was also observed in the previous examination, around the defined changes. At this level, there is a 2 mm diameter nodule. It could not be identified within the consolidation area in the previous review. There is prominence in the lower lobes of both lungs, especially in the subpleural interlobular septa at the laterobasal level. A stable 6x4 mm nodule is observed in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. There is another nodule with a diameter of 3 mm slightly inferiorly. Two nodules with a diameter of 3 mm are observed at the posterobasal level. There was no finding compatible with pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pneumonia. Degenerative changes are observed in the bone structure entering the examination area.\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n"
