FINDINGS:

Vasculature
• Multiple venous collaterals are present in the anterior left chest wall and are associated with the anterior jugular vein at the level of the right sternoclavicular junction.
• The left subclavian vein is collapsed, suggestive of chronic occlusion.
• Other mediastinal main vascular structures are normal.

Trachea/Bronchi
- The trachea and both main bronchi are open.

Aorta
• Calcific plaques are observed in the aortic arch.
• The thoracic aorta diameter is normal.

Heart
• Heart contour and size are normal.
• No pericardial effusion or thickening was observed.

Esophagus
- The thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected.

Lymph Nodes
- No enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal, or bilateral hilar-axillary regions.

Lungs
• Linear atelectasis is present in both lung parenchyma.
• Subsegmental atelectasis is observed in the right middle lobe.
• Thickening of the bronchial wall and peribronchial tree-in-bud reticulonodular densities are observed in the bilateral lower lobes, with peribronchial minimal consolidation in places, suggestive of an infectious process.

Kidneys
• The left kidney, which is partially included in the scan, is atrophic.
• The right kidney was not included in the scan and could not be evaluated.

Abdomen
- Other upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal.

Liver
- No space-occupying lesion was detected in the visualized portion of the liver.

Adrenal Glands
- Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected.

Bones
- There are osteophytes with anterior extension in the thoracic vertebrae.
