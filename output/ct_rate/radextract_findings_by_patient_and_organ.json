Additionally, advanced degenerative changes in LWS, maximum point in segment L3-L1. Minimal pseudoretrolisthesis of D1 from 2 and D2 from 3 approximately 5 mm without associated spondylolysis. Consecutive mild grade neuroforaminal bony narrowing of right L1 and 2 and left L2 neuroforamen. No high-grade spinal or neuroforaminal bony narrowing. Mild pleural effusion on the left side. Pulmonary venous congestion signs. Multiple renal cysts bilaterally, partially with calcified portions in the upper pole bilaterally. Perirenal stranding. Silent cholelithiasis. Elongation and sclerosis of abdominal aorta with moderate stenosis of celiac trunk and high-grade stenosis of mesenteric artery at calcified plaques. Calcification also of the pelvic axis bilaterally.",

With dilated internal ventricular chambers, there is a hydrocephalus (ventriculomegaly). Distally, the anterior cerebral arteries are displaced laterally up to the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery on both sides, but overall well-contrasted. Contrast of the arterial vessels in the anterior and posterior circulation areas is uniform without high-grade stenoses or disruptions. No aneurysms were found.",
