    "trachea": "Trachea, both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the lumen.",

    "Findings": " The right breast was not observed secondary to the operation. Thickening of the skin in the operation site, and increases in density consistent with post-op sequelae changes in subcutaneous fat planes were observed. Surgical suture materials were observed in the operation site and right axilla. A mass lesion with distinguishable borders in the left breast, no lymph node in pathological size and appearance was observed in the left axilla. Trachea and both main bronchi were in the midline and no obstructive pathology was detected in the lumen. On the left, a catheter image extending to the port chamber and superior-right atrium junction of the vena cava and anterior chest wall was observed. In the non-contrast examination, the mediastinum was not evaluated optimally. As far as can be seen; mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Pathological lymph nodes were observed in the bilateral supraclavicular region, measuring 25x14 mm in size on the left and 12x10 mm in size on the right. Lymph nodes of 15x13 mm in pathological size and appearance were observed adjacent to the left subclavian artery and at the level of the left aortapulmonary window, the largest of which was adjacent to the left subclavian artery. In other parts of the mediastinum, lymph nodes with short axes less than 1 cm that did not reach pathological dimensions were observed. It is also present in previous examinations. No significant difference was detected. In both hemithorax, effusion measuring 16. In the left hemithorax, thickening of the posterior costal pleura is observed. It is stable. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Patchy ground-glass consolidations were observed in the right lung apex, anterior and posterior segments, and in the peripheral subpleural areas of the middle lobe, forming a crazy paving pattern. The findings described may be compatible with radiation pneumonia or Covid-19 pneumonia. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory. Suspicious ground glass opacities are also observed in the peripheral subpleural areas of the left lung lingular segment. A few millimetric nonspecific parenchymal nodules were observed in both lungs. In the non-contrast examination, intra-abdominal solid organs and vascular structures could not be evaluated. Further testing is recommended. Destruction area compatible with metastasis was observed in the sternum corpus. PET-CT examination revealed that FDG uptake belonging to metastasis in the thoracic vertebral corpus was found in the patient, and no lytic-destructive lesion in favor of metastasis was detected in the vertebrae within the CT limits."

    "Findings": "Metastatic lymph nodes were observed in the supraclavicular fossa, lateral to the right axilla pectoralis minor muscle, and in the mediastinum. Heart sizes are normal. Calibration of the mediastinal main vascular structures is normal. The acquisition was performed in expiration. Trachea and both main bronchi appear collapsed. Pleural effusion with a diameter of 12 mm between the leaves of the right pleura and 10 mm in diameter between the leaves of the left pleura is observed. Asymmetric parenchymal infiltration areas, predominantly in the form of ground glass density and areas of consolidation in both lungs, were evaluated in favor of pneumonic infiltration and there is a radiological pattern compatible with Covid pneumonia. It caused compression in the bronchial lumens. It may belong to new metastatic lesions. Contrast-enhanced examination will be appropriate. In the upper abdominal sections, an increase in liver size and metastatic lesions in the parenchyma are observed. In the case with bone metastases, no space-occupying lesion that can be distinguished by CT was observed in the bone structures.",
    "heart": "Heart sizes are normal.",
    "trachea": "Trachea and both main bronchi appear collapsed.",
    "lung": "Asymmetric parenchymal infiltration areas, predominantly in the form of ground glass density and areas of consolidation in both lungs, were evaluated in favor of pneumonic infiltration and there is a radiological pattern compatible with Covid pneumonia.

    "liver": "An increase in liver size and metastatic lesions in the parenchyma are observed.",
    "aorta": "Calibration of the mediastinal main vascular structures is normal. (But the report doesn't mention the aorta specifically, just the mediastinal structures. However, the list includes \"Aorta,\" so maybe the description should include that the mediastinal vascular structures are normal, which includes the aorta.)"

  "train_17_a": {
    "Findings": "Trachea, both main bronchi are open. Mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Slight patchy ground glass densities with pleural location are observed at the posterior levels of the lower lobes of both lungs. The findings were evaluated in favor of the infectious process. Clinical, laboratory correlation is recommended for the differential diagnosis of Covid-19 viral pneumonia due to the current pandemic. There is an appearance compatible with hepatosteatosis in the liver parenchyma entering the section area. Other upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved."
