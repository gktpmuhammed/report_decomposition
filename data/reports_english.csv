Ss9Z66yVeu8_1_1,"Complication-free IV bolus application of Imeron 400, followed by multi-slice Spiral CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in venous contrast phase. Additional oral contrast (with Micropaque 1:7 in water, with Gastrolux 1:33 in water). Dual-energy reconstructions for Duodenal layer and coronal and sagittal secondary reconstructions. Additional medication: Prednisolon on station known for contrast medium reaction. Unremarkable presentation of the basal lung segments. No pleural effusion. No suspicious round intrapulmonary nodules. No active infiltrates. Central positioning of the cardiomedias-tinum. No pericardial effusion. Liver parenchyma evenly contrasted without evidence of densely differentiated focal lesions. Gallbladder filled and irritationless. Liver veins and portal vein freely perfused. No intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. Both adrenals normal. Unremarkable presentation of pancreas and spleen. Symmetrical contrast of renal parenchyma. No hydronephrosis. Unremarkable presentation of the urinary bladder. Normal passage of orally applied contrast agent to the left colon flexure. No indication of intestinal passage obstruction. Irritationless presentation of the appendix. No evidence of free fluid or free intra-abdominal air. Calcified uterus myoma. No evidence of inguinal lymphadenopathy below the diaphragm. Minimal degenerative changes to the spine. No evidence of suspicious osseous lesions.",No ileus present. No clear intra-abdominal infectious focus discernible.
DJJ9wVjkyJU_1_1,"Continuous multi-slice Spiral-CT in native axial stacking. Thin slice reconstructions. Assessed is the spine from D11 to lumbosacral junction. Osteoporotic bone aspect, older suggesting. Ground and surface plates impression at D12, mostly osteoporotic (Genant 2) without clear marginal involvement. Additionally, advanced degenerative changes in LWS, maximum point in segment L3-L1. Minimal pseudoretrolisthesis of D1 from 2 and D2 from 3 approximately 5 mm without associated spondylolysis. Consecutive mild grade neuroforaminal bony narrowing of right L1 and 2 and left L2 neuroforamen. No high-grade spinal or neuroforaminal bony narrowing. Mild pleural effusion on the left side. Pulmonary venous congestion signs. Multiple renal cysts bilaterally, partially with calcified portions in the upper pole bilaterally. Perirenal stranding. Silent cholelithiasis. Elongation and sclerosis of abdominal aorta with moderate stenosis of celiac trunk and high-grade stenosis of mesenteric artery at calcified plaques. Calcification also of the pelvic axis bilaterally.","Non-specific osteoporotic appearance of vertebral body (12, named 2) without definite posterior margin 2 involvement. No high-grade spinal or neuroforaminal bony narrowing present."
pPq5uIsBEoo_1_1,"Large sellar mass lesion with convexity in the left atrium of the ventricle, known from MRT-VU on 15.12.23. With dilated internal ventricular chambers, there is a hydrocephalus (ventriculomegaly). Distally, the anterior cerebral arteries are displaced laterally up to the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery on both sides, but overall well-contrasted. Contrast of the arterial vessels in the anterior and posterior circulation areas is uniform without high-grade stenoses or disruptions. No aneurysms were found.",Known extensive atrioventricular septal aneurysm with dorsal curvature in the left ventricle. Distal ACI and proximal MCA displaced laterally. Completely surrounding arterial vessels.
pgrUFnHSHaE_1_1,"Cross-sectional Spiral CT through Thorax, Abdomen, Pelvis in venous contrast phase and excretion phase post i.v. application of Imeron 400 with oral contrast. Thin-slice reconstructions and secondary coronary and sagittal reconstructions. Thorax: Unremarkable visualization of the enfolded neck structures, particularly the thyroid. Mediastinal positioning of the heart. With regard to coronary stenting. Normally enhanced contrast of the cardiac chambers and central vessels. No pericardial effusion. Unchanged representation of mediastinal lymph nodes without pathologically enlarged examples. Also, consistently sized lymph nodes between the left main bronchus and pulmonary artery with tracer enhancement in the initial investigation (PET CT on 10/23). No pathologically enlarged hilar or axillary lymph nodes bilaterally.",Anti-PD1 antibody (Pembrolizumab)
gBIgsYSmY8k_1_1,"Continuous axial layer scanning through the LWS using multi-slice spiral technique natively. Dynagram reconstructions in coronal and sagittal planes. Arrosion of the base plate LWK 4 and the cover plate LWK 5 with adjacent multisclerosis of the vertebral body. No evidence of recent fracture. Correct posterior border alignment and position within the facet joints. Renal lesions on both sides with partially cystic density values, differential diagnosis renal cysts. If not known, sonographic correlation recommended.","No evidence of a fresh fracture. Changes in LWK 4/5 as described above. Cannot differentiate CT-morphologically between degenerative changes and changes within the context of (resolved) spondylodiscitis. Clinical, laboratory, and possibly MRI recommended for correlation."
