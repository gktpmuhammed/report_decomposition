Ss9Z66yVeu8_1_1,"Complications-free intravenous bolus administration of Imeron 400, followed by multi-slice spiral CT scan through the abdomen and pelvis in venous contrast phase. Additional oral contrast (Micropaque 1:7 in water, Gastrolux 1:33 in water). Dual-energy reconstruction for duodenal layers as well as coronal and sagittal secondary reconstructions. Additional medication: Prednisolon on station with known contrast medium reaction. Unremarkable depiction of the basal lung sections. No pleural effusion. No suspicious round opacities in the lungs. No active infiltrates. Central positioning of the cardiac mediastinum. No pericardial effusion. Homogeneously contrasted liver parenchyma without evidence of differentially focused focal lesions. Distended and unirritated gallbladder. Liver veins and portal vein well-perfused. No intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. Both adrenals normal. Unremarkable depiction of the pancreas and spleen. Symmetric contrasting of the kidney parenchyma. No hydronephrosis. Unremarkable depiction of the urinary bladder. Regular passage of orally applied contrast agent up to the left colon flexure. No evidence of intestinal obstruction. Calcified uterine myoma. No evidence of inguinal lymphadenopathy below the diaphragm. Minimal degenerative changes in the spine. No suspicious osseous lesions.",No ileus. No definite intra-abdominal focus of infection distinguishable.
DJJ9wVjkyJU_1_1,"Continuous multi-slice Spiral-CT in native continuous axial section, thin-slice reconstructions. Assessed is the spine from D11 to the lumbosacral junction. Osteoporotic appearance of BWK 12, most likely osteoporotic (Genant 2) without clear involvement of the posterior edge. Also shows advanced degenerative changes in the LWS, maximum point in segment LWK 3-SWK 1. Minimal pseudoretrolisthesis of LWK 1 versus 2 and LWK 2 versus 3 about 5 mm without associated spondylolysis. Consecutive mild neuroforaminal bony narrowing of the right L1, L2 and left L2 foramen. No high-grade spinal or neuroforaminal bony stenosis. Mild pleural effusion in the left basal region. Pulmonary venous congestion signs. Multiple kidney cysts on both sides, partly with calcified parts in the upper regions of both sides. Perirenal stranding. Silent cholelithiasis. Elongation and sclerosis of the abdominal aorta with moderate stenosis of the celiac trunk's origin and high-grade stenosis of the mesenteric artery at calcified plaques. Calcification also in the pelvic axis on both sides.","Advanced age appearance, suggestive of osteoporotic impression from L12 (named 2) without clear involvement of the posterior border 2. No higher-grade spinal or neuroforaminal bony stenosis present."
pPq5uIsBEoo_1_1,"Large sellar mass formation with anterior bulging in the left atrium ventricle from MRI-VU on 12/15/23. Enlarged internal ventricular chambers, with hydrocephalus. Distal ACI bilaterally displaced to M1 segment of MCI bilaterally, but overall consistently constricted. Contrast agent consistently distributed in the arterial vessels in both the anterior and posterior territories without high-grade stenoses or vessel rupture. No aneurysms present.",Known large atrial septal aneurysm with bulging into the left atrium. The distal ACI and proximal MCA are displaced laterally. Completely circumferential arterial vessels.
pgrUFnHSHaE_1_1,"Complications-free intravenous bolus administration of Imeron 400, followed by multislice spiral CT scan through Thorax, Abdomen, Pelvis in venous contrast phase and excretion phase with additional oral contrasting. Thin-slice reconstructions as well as coronal and sagittal secondary reconstructions. Thorax: Unremarkable depiction of fused neck structures, especially the thyroid. Central mediastinum. With regard to coronary stenting. Orientationally correct contrasting of heart chambers and central vessels. No pericardial effusion. Unchanged representation of mediastinal lymph nodes without pathologically enlarged nodes. Also, size-constant lymph nodes between the main bronchus and pulmonary artery with tracer enrichment in the preliminary examination (PET CT from 10/23). No pathologically enlarged hilar and axillary nodes on both sides.",Anti-PD1 antibody (Pembrolizumab)
gBIgsYSmY8k_1_1,"Continuous axial sectioning through the LWS using multi-line spiral technique natively. Reconstructions of the DÃ¼hnnschicht and coronary and sagittal secondary reconstructions. Erosion of the baseplate LWK 4 and coverplate LWK 5, each with adjacent multisclerosis of the vertebral body. No evidence of a fresh fracture. Appropriate posterior border alignment and position in facet joints. Renal lesions on both sides with partially cystic attenuation values, differential diagnosis renal cysts. If not known, ultrasound correlation is recommended.","No evidence of fresh fracture. Changes in LWK 4/5 as previously described. Cannot differentiate between degenerative changes and changes within the context of (completed) spondylodiscitis using CT morphology. Clinical, laboratory chemical correlation and MRI recommended if necessary."
