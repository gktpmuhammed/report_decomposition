    "Findings": "As far as can be observed within the limits of non-contrast CT: Right lung middle lobe medial segment is observed as atelectatically. A mass surrounding the bronchus is observed around the middle lobe bronchus of the right lung. The mass and the atelectasis segment cannot be clearly differentiated because no contrast material is given. However, as far as can be observed, the longest diameter of the mass was approximately 53 mm at the level of the right middle lobe bronchus. When the previous examination of the patient is examined, it is understood that the patient has a primary mass in this localization. Numerous masses are observed in the superior and anterior mediastinum, prevascular, paratracheal and both hilar regions. When the previous examinations of the patient were examined, it was understood that the described masses were lymphadenopathies. In this examination, the borders of lymphadenopathies cannot be distinguished from each other and show conglomeration. The longest diameter of the conglomerating lymphadenopathies was approximately 116 mm at the widest part (series 2 section 150). Pleural effusion is observed on the right. The pleural effusion continues to the apex of the lung when the patient is in the supine position. The effusion measured approximately 7 cm at its thickest point. There is also minimal pleural effusion on the left. No pleural thickening was detected. Heart contour and size are normal. The widths of the mediastinal main vascular structures are normal. There are calcific atheromatous plaques in the aorta and coronary arteries. Pericardial effusion measuring approximately 30 mm is observed in its thickest part. No pathological increase in wall thickness was detected in the esophagus within the sections. Ground-glass appearances are observed in the upper lobe of the left lung, especially in the central part, and interlobular septal and interstitial thickenings are observed in this localization. The described appearance is absent in the previous examination of the patient. If the patient received radiotherapy, the described appearance was considered to be compatible with the change due to radiotherapy. No mass was detected in the left lung. In the upper lobe of the right lung, there are several nodules, the largest of which is 13 mm in diameter, in the posterior segment, in the lateral part. There is a slight increase in the size of the nodule, which is described as the largest. No significant difference was found in the others. The liver is larger than normal. There are large masses in both lobes of the liver. The sizes of the masses cannot be distinguished from each other in places. The largest of the described masses is observed in the left lobe. Its longest diameter measured approximately 150 mm. No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections. There are lymphadenopathies at the level of the hiatus aorticus in the portal hilus and aortic anterior. However, the borders of lymphadenopathies cannot be distinguished from each other and from the liver. Therefore, the optimal size cannot be given. As far as can be observed, a minimal increase in the size of the described lymphadenopathies is also observed. There are sclerotic bone lesions in the bone structures within the sections. When the patient was evaluated together with the primary disease, it was understood that the described appearances were compatible with metastases. No soft tissue component was detected accompanying the described lesions."

    "Findings": "Mediastinal structures cannot be evaluated optimally because contrast material is not given. As far as can be observed: A malignant infiltrative mass is observed around the right main bronchus, especially extending around the middle lobe and lower lobe bronchi. The mass narrows the bronchial structures. The described mass appears to invade the trachea and the left main bronchus. The mass borders are also indistinguishable from the esophagus. The middle lobe and lower lobe of the right lung are almost completely atelectic. The mass described in the central part of the right lung extends to the lung parenchyma, especially in the middle lobe and lower lobe. However, the extent of the mass cannot be evaluated clearly due to the presence of atelectasis. The mass described in the right lung measured approximately 101 mm at its widest point. Apart from the described mass, there are also multiple lymphadenopathies in the mediastinum and hilar region, some of which are indistinguishable from the described mass. There are also lymphadenopathies in the medial parts of the bilateral supraclavicular region, more prominent on the right. The largest lymphadenopathies with distinguishable borders are observed in the right supraclavicular region and paratracheal area, and their short diameters are approximately 30 mm. There is pleural effusion on the right. It is understood that pleural effusion has also appeared recently. No pleural effusion was detected on the left. Emphysematous changes and linear atelectesis are observed in the aerated right lung and left lung. There are also smooth interlobular septal thickenings in the right lung. The described finding is not specific. However, when evaluated together with the primary disease, it was thought to be due to lymphangitis carcinomatosa, albeit less likely. This finding was also not observed in the previous examination of the patient. There is a nodule measuring approximately 8 mm in diameter in the lateral part of the left lung upper lobe apicoposterior segment posterior subsegment. This nodule cannot be evaluated clearly due to artefacts of motion. In addition, there is another similar nodule about 10 mm in diameter in the left lung upper lobe lingular segment. A honeycomb appearance is observed in the peripheral areas of the lower lobe of the left lung. No upper abdominal free fluid-collection was detected in the sections. An irregularly circumscribed mass measuring approximately 31x27 mm was observed in the preaortic region at the level of origin of the turuncus celiac. The described mass was considered to be metastatic lymphadenopathy. Apart from the mass evaluated in favor of the described lymphadenopathy, other lymphadenopathies are also observed in and around the truncus celiac. An increase in the size of these lymphadenopathies was also detected. There is a nodular solid lesion measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter in the subcutaneous adipose tissue in the anterior at the lower part of the right hemithorax. There may be a metastasis in this lesion. Irregularity in liver contours was observed. It is recommended that the patient be evaluated for chronic liver parenchymal disease. In addition, there is a hypodense lesion measuring approximately 22 mm in diameter in the posterior segment (segment 7) of the right lobe of the liver. The lesion could not be characterized in this examination as no contrast agent was given. However, this appearance was not observed in the PET CT examination of the patient. Therefore, it was thought that metastasis may occur. If there is an indication, it is recommended to be used further. In addition, there is another millimetric hypodense lesion in the medial and lateral segments of the left lobe of the liver. Metastases may be present in these lesions. No lytic-destructive lesions were detected in the bone structures within the sections. As far as can be observed: An increase in the size of the patient's primary mass was observed. In addition, it is understood that the right lung aeration is worse in this examination. There is also an increase in the size of lymphadenopathies observed in the mediastinum, hilar regions and abdomen. Two nodules were observed in the left lung, and it is understood that one of these nodules has just appeared and the other one has increased in size. There are lesions in the liver that were not observed in the patient's previous PET CT scan. It is recommended that the patient be evaluated together with contrast-enhanced examinations, if any. It appears that the pleural effusion on the right has just appeared."

There is a pleural effusion reaching 6 cm between the leaves of the right pleura and 2 cm between the leaves of the left pleura. There are diffuse metastatic lesions in all segments of both lungs. The largest is located in the upper lobe of the left lung, with a long axis of 27 mm and a diameter of 16 mm, located peripherally in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung. On previous imaging, these lesions measured 31 mm and 16 mm. Some of the other metastatic lung lesions have mild regression in their size, and some are stable. No new lesion was detected. Widespread metastatic lesions are observed in the vertebrae, ribs, both clavicles and sternum in all bone structures that enter the imaging field. There are components showing extraosseous extension in places. Also available in old rendering. A newly developed pathological fracture is observed in the right 2nd posterior rib. In the T9 vertebra, the extraosseous component of the tumoral lesion in the vertebral body extends into the spinal canal. It is evident in the current review. If necessary, MRI examination is recommended. In the metastatic lesion in the L1 vertebral body, it occupies a significant volume in the vertebral body. Therefore, it poses a risk for fracture. The metastatic lesion in the L1 vertebral body is also observed with its extraosseous component extending towards the right pararenal area. It is also available in the old review. It appears to be slightly regressed in current examination. In the sections passing through the upper abdomen, calculus is observed in the gallbladder. The right kidney is operated.

    "Findings": " The trachea was in the midline of both main bronchi and no obstructive pathology was detected in the lumen. On the right, a catheter extending to the port chamber and superior-right atrium junction of the vena cava and anterior chest wall was observed. The mediastinum could not be evaluated optimally in the non-contrast examination. As far as can be seen; The ascending aorta is wider than normal with an anterior-posterior diameter of 41 mm. The diameters of the pulmonary trunk right and left pulmonary arteries were measured as 38 mm, 28 mm and 21 mm, respectively. The heart size is increased, especially in the left ventricle and atrium. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. Multiple lymph nodes measuring 11 mm in diameter are observed in the mediastinal, upper-lower paratracheal, prevascular, aortopulmonary, subcarinal, bilateral hilar localization, the largest of which is on the short axis. The largest of the lymph nodes was measured 17. Multiple lymph nodes were observed in the right axillary, bilateral retropectoral, both supraclavicular localizations and bilateral lower cervical chain entering the examination area. Postoperative changes, parenchymal distortion and post-op suture materials in the parenchyma were observed in the right breast. Pleural effusion measuring 8.8 cm in the widest part on the right and 5. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Attectic changes were observed in the upper lobe of the right lung middle lobe and the lingular segment of the left lung upper lobe. Segmental-subsegmental peribronchial thickening was observed in both lungs. Focal nodular consolidation areas were observed in the right lung lower lobe anterobasal and left lung lower lobe anteromediobasal segment, and the appearance was evaluated in favor of infective processes. Viral-fungal infections, primarily Covid-19 pneumonia, were considered in the differential diagnosis. No mass lesion with distinguishable borders was detected in both lungs. As far as can be observed in the sections, the stomach was not observed secondary to the operation. The case has gastrojejunostomy anastomosis line. No suspicious increase in wall thickness was detected in the non-contrast examination at the level of the anastomosis line. There is free fluid in the abdomen. The gallbladder was not observed (cholecystectomized?). No lytic-destructive lesion in favor of metastasis was observed in bone structures.",
