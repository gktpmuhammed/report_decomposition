    "Findings": "Continuous Spiral CT with native axial slicing and thin-slice reconstructions, scanning the spine from L11 to the lumbosacral junction. Osteopener bone aspect. Impression of older ground and plate at L12, most likely osteoporotic (Genant 2) without clear involvement of the posterior edge. Also shows advanced degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, maximum point in segment L3-L1. Minimal pseudoretrolisthesis of L1 over 2 and L2 over 3 about 5 mm without associated spondylolysis. Consecutive mild neuroforaminal bony narrowing of the right L1 and 2 and left L2 foramen. No high-grade spinal or neuroforaminal bony stenosis. Mild pleural effusion on the left side. Pulmonary venous congestion signs. Multiple renal cysts on both sides, some with calcified components in the upper pole on both sides. Perirenal stranding. Silent cholelithiasis. Elongation and sclerosis of the abdominal aorta with moderate stenosis of the celiac trunk and high-grade stenosis of the mesenteric artery at calcified plaques. Calcification also of the pelvic axis on both sides.",

    "Findings": "Known from the MRT-VU on 15.12.23, large sellar space-occupying lesion with bulging into the left lateral ventricle. With dilated internal ventricular spaces, hydrocephalus. Distal ACI on both sides up to M1-segment of MCA on both sides is laterally displaced but overall consistently constricted. Outside of this, consistent contrasting of arterial vessels in the anterior and posterior vascular territory without high-grade stenosis or vessel rupture. No aneurysms.",

    "Findings": "Continuous axial stacking through LWS in multi-slice spiral technique natively. Reconstructions of thin slices and coronary and sagittal secondary reconstructions. Erosion of the base plate LWK 4 and the dome plate LWK 5 with adjacent increased sclerosis of the vertebral body. No evidence of a recent fracture. Normal alignment at the posterior corners and position in the facet joints. Renal lesions on both sides with partly cystic attenuation values, Differential Diagnosis: Renal cysts. If not known, sonographic correlation recommended.",

    "Findings": "Imaging technique: Complication-free bolus intravenous application of Imeron 400, multi-slice spiral CT through thorax, abdomen, pelvis in venous contrast phase and excretion phase with additional oral contrast administration. Thin-section reconstructions as well as coronary and sagittal secondary reconstructions. Thorax: Orientationally unremarkable depiction of the mediated neck structures, particularly the thyroid. Central positioning of the mediastinum. Coronary stenting in place. Orientationally regular contrasting of heart chambers and central vessels. No pericardial effusion. Unchanged presentation of mediastinal lymph nodes without enlarged pathological examples. Also size-constant lymph nodes between left main bronchus and pulmonary artery with tracer enrichment in the previous examination (PET CT from 10/23). No enlarged hilar or axillary lymph nodes on either side."

    "Findings": "Complications-free intravenous bolus application of Imeron 400 followed by multi-slice spiral CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in venous contrast phase, with additional oral contrast (Micropaque 1:7 in water, Gastrolux 1:33 in water). Dual-energy reformations, coronal and sagittal secondary reconstructions. Additional medication: Prednisolone on station due to known contrast media reaction. Unremarkable presentation of the imaged basal lung segments. No pleural effusion. No suspicious intrapulmonary masses. No florid infiltrates. Central position of the heart and mediastinum. No pericardial effusion. Homogeneously enhanced liver parenchyma without evidence of conspicuous focal lesions. Distended and unremarkable gallbladder. Liver veins and portal vein well perfused. No intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. Both adrenals normal. Unremarkable presentation of the pancreas and spleen. Symmetrical enhancement of the renal parenchyma. No hydronephrosis. Unremarkable presentation of the urinary bladder. Normal passage of orally administered contrast to the left colon flexure. No evidence of intestinal obstruction. Unremarkable presentation of the appendix. No evidence of free fluid or free intra-abdominal air. Calcified uterus myoma. No evidence of inguinal lymphadenopathy below the diaphragm. Slight degenerative changes in the spine. No evidence of suspicious osteogenic lesions."
