    "Conclusion": "No evidence of acute fracture. Changes in LWK 4/5 as previously described. Cannot distinguish CT-morphologically between degenerative changes and changes within the context of (resolved) spondylodiscitis. Clinical correlation, laboratory testing, and MRI if necessary are recommended."
